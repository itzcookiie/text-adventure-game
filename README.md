# text-adventure-game

### Mini project

### Lil text adventure game based off the bible. Enter 4 rooms and fight against the enemy using the Word of God!

    Make sure you have Python 3 installed!

How to run game:

- Create your own env by doing `python3 -m venv env` and activate it
- Install packages by doing `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app using `python -m main.py`
  

How game works:
- Will be prompted to enter your username
- After entering username, you will have the option to enter 4 different room numbers: 1 - 4
- Use the arrow keys to access a room
- Each room you will have the option to fight or flee
- If you choose to fight, you will fight against the enemy
- The enemy will throw a temptation at you. You will then be given the option of 4 different scripture/verses
- Pick the right scripture/verse to defeat the enemy
- You clear a room after picking the right scripture/verse
- Gain exp after clearing each room
- Clear all 4 rooms to win!

Future ideas:
- Add more rooms
- Add an inventory system, so user can e.g. pick up more bible verses (imagine having sheets of pages of the bible in your backpack, like collecting the bible)
- Use newly picked up bible verses to unlock clear more room
- Add e.g. treasure boxes with codes that you have to solve in order to get more bible verses
- The treasure box will have a riddle e.g. maybe it'll tell a little story like "A man that loved God with all his heart, but fell to the women who was bathing before my eyes. Who am I? (David)'
- Can have a skill point system e.g. wisdom, grace, strength, faith, authority, patience
- Different verses (out of the options to pick during a battle) have different fighting techniques (like runescape)
- E.g. option a) is slash. option b) is stab etc
- You can buy armour e.g. breastplate of righteousness using faith
- Patience skill can be increased over time e.g. create account then come back after 2 days. Will need a database at this point or just a file for storing this data
- Add sound to when bible verses are spoken
- Have option to e.g. study the bible, pray etc
